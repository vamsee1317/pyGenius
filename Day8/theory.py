# Modules & Packages :

# What is Module ?
# A module is a single file that contains a set of related functions, classes, and variables. It can be used to organize code, make it reusable, and improve code readability.
# Each module can be exported & imported where ever we needed.


# Steps to work with modules:
# 1. Create a module
# 2. Import the module
    # Importing the entire file
    # Importing specific functions or variables
    # Importing all the functions
# 3. Use the module
